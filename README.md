# Object-Measure-using-Computer-Vision
Development of an application to measure objects through of computer vision with a phone camera.


This Project was made with Python in Google Colab, by Carlos Coronado Zúñiga and Adrián Monge Barahona, College ITCR, Costa Rica.


- First, it calculates the effective focal length of a camera
phone, through a montage way.

- Develops a
application to use it as a measurement instrument
common objects, of a single color, without much variation.

The application receives as input the working distance
and the image of the object against the background (IN 320X240 RESOLUTION OR EQUIVALENT WIDTH
320), and returns the measure of the width of the object in real units, checking the results against the measure obtained by a non-visual method.
